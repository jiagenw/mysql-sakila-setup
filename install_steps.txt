# Sakila Database Installation Steps

## Step 1: Install MySQL
- Download MySQL at this link: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=544297
- ✅ COMPLETED

## Step 2: Add MySQL to PATH
- Find where MySQL was installed (usually /usr/local/mysql/bin or /Applications/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/bin)
- Add to PATH or create alias
- ✅ COMPLETED

Commands run:
```bash
# Check if MySQL is installed in common locations
ls -la /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql 2>/dev/null || ls -la /Applications/MySQL*/bin/mysql 2>/dev/null || echo "MySQL not found in common locations"

# Add MySQL bin directory to PATH permanently (so mysql command works from anywhere)
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

# Reload shell configuration to apply the PATH change immediately
source ~/.zshrc

# Test if mysql command is now available
mysql --version
# ✅ RESULT: mysql Ver 9.4.0 for macos15 on arm64 (MySQL Community Server - GPL)
```

## Step 3: Create Fresh Database
- Drop existing database if it exists and create new one
- Import complete schema with all 16 tables, 7 views, and 3 stored functions

Commands to run:
```bash
# Create fresh database
mysql -u root -p -e "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS fun_sql; CREATE DATABASE fun_sql;"

# Import complete schema (16 tables, 7 views, 3 stored functions)
mysql -u root -p fun_sql < movie_rental_sakila/sakila-schema-fun_sql.sql

# Verify tables were created
mysql -u root -p fun_sql -e "SHOW TABLES;"
```

✅ COMPLETED - All 16 tables and 7 views created successfully!

## Step 4: Import Complete Data (46,000+ records)
- Import all sample data including payments, rentals, films, customers, etc.
- This will populate all tables with realistic movie rental data

Commands to run:
```bash
# Import complete data (3.2MB, ~46,000 records)
mysql -u root -p fun_sql < sakila-data-fun_sql.sql

# Verify data import
mysql -u root -p fun_sql -e "SELECT 'payment' as table_name, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM payment UNION ALL SELECT 'rental', COUNT(*) FROM rental ORDER BY record_count DESC;"

# Additional verification
mysql -u root -p fun_sql -e "SELECT 'film' as table_name, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM film UNION ALL SELECT 'customer', COUNT(*) FROM customer UNION ALL SELECT 'actor', COUNT(*) FROM actor UNION ALL SELECT 'inventory', COUNT(*) FROM inventory ORDER BY record_count DESC;"
```
